# The purpose of this project

Toffle is a web application made to answer the problem 'What to watch'.
It is an app that involves API, Authentication, JSON Web token and Typescript.
This project was made to discover the framework Angular.
The point of this project was to gain skills and discover something different from Vue that I already knew a bit.

# The discovery of frameworks

Angular is the first JS framework I tried. It was the first time, I had to think where to put my code and how to
structure it. The notion of component was new to me, and I made the choice to use Sass to make my life easier.

# The choice of the API

I had never used an API before, so I had to learn what it was and how to use it. I chose to use the API of The Movie
Database (TMDb) because it was the easiest to start with. I then learned what asynchronous programming was and how to
handle fetching data.
