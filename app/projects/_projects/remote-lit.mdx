# Why this project ?

I wanted to control my computer from my bed, so I made this project.
It's a remote controller to control your mouse and your keyboard from your bed (lit is bed in French).
More than that it was the first time I used Node.js and I wanted to try it. Moreover, I had heard of Websockets and I
wanted to try it too.

# How it works ?

The project is served by an Express server, which is a Node.js framework. The server is listening on port 3000 and
serves the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) and the Websocket server. The Websocket server is listening on port 8080.

When the user connects to the server, the server sends him the HTML file. The HTML file contains the CSS and the JS to make
the page interactive and to connect to the Websocket server. When the user connects to the Websocket server, the server
listens to the events sent by the client, which will be interpreted by the server and sent to the computer.

# Retrospective

I really enjoyed this project, it was the first time I used Node.js and I really liked it. It is really the project that
I did without any guidelines I like it as much as I know I could do better now. I may come back to this project in the
future to improve it with the knowledge I have now.
